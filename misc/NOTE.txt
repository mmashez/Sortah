requirements: Windows XP SP2+ (powershell requirements)
After Effects CS4 9.0/2008+ (if you want your project started up with auto-importing, if not, disable isAfterFX in config.json)

most minimum requirements!..

the app will ask to run as administrator, or else it wont be able to auto-execute the scripts on after effects launch.. (used for auto-importing footage, as After Effects is commonly installed in the Program Files folder.)
if you would NOT like that, then, source code is yours !
