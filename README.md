# sortah.

sortah is a minimalist file organizer built to help content creators manage their project files through fully customizable settings defined in `config.json`.  
it is primarily targeted at adobe after effects® cs4 (v9.0, 2008 or higher) users.

> ⚠️ **platform support:**  
> currently supports **windows only**.  
> as noted in `note.txt`, the minimum requirement is **Windows XP SP2+**, as this tool relies on powershell to start your editing software, referred to from `config.json`
